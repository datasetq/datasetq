## ⚠️ IMPORTANT - DO NOT CREATE A PUBLIC ISSUE FOR SECURITY VULNERABILITIES

If you have discovered a security vulnerability, please **DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue.

Instead, please report it privately by emailing: **security@durableprogramming.com**

## What to Include in Your Report

When reporting a security vulnerability, please include:

1. **Description**: Clear description of the vulnerability
2. **Impact**: What could an attacker achieve?
3. **Steps to Reproduce**: Detailed steps to reproduce the issue
4. **Proof of Concept**: Code or commands demonstrating the vulnerability
5. **Affected Versions**: Which versions are affected?
6. **Suggested Fix**: If you have ideas for how to fix it (optional)

## Our Commitment

- **Response Time**: We aim to respond within 48 hours
- **Updates**: We will keep you informed of our progress
- **Credit**: We will credit you in our security advisory (unless you prefer to remain anonymous)
- **Coordinated Disclosure**: We request time to fix the issue before public disclosure

## Our Security Policy

For more information, please see our [SECURITY.md](../../SECURITY.md) file.

## Non-Security Issues

If your issue is not a security vulnerability (e.g., general bug, feature request), please use the appropriate issue template instead:

- **Bug Report**: For functional issues that don't have security implications
- **Feature Request**: For suggesting new features or enhancements

Thank you for helping keep DSQ secure!
